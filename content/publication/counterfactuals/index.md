publication: "Gumbel Counterfactual Generation From Language Models"
publication_short: ""

abstract: "Understanding and manipulating the causal generation mechanisms in language models is essential for controlling their behavior. Previous work has primarily relied on techniques such as representation surgery -- e.g., model ablations or manipulation of linear subspaces tied to specific concepts -- to \emph{intervene} on these models. To understand the impact of interventions precisely, it is useful to examine counterfactuals -- e.g., how a given sentence would have appeared had it been generated by the model following a specific intervention. We highlight that counterfactual reasoning is conceptually distinct from interventions, as articulated in Pearl's causal hierarchy. Based on this observation, we propose a framework for generating true string counterfactuals by reformulating language models as a structural equation model using the Gumbel-max trick, which we called Gumbel counterfactual generation. This reformulation allows us to model the joint distribution over original strings and their counterfactuals resulting from the same instantiation of the sampling noise. We develop an algorithm based on hindsight Gumbel sampling that allows us to infer the latent noise variables and generate counterfactuals of observed strings. Our experiments demonstrate that the approach produces meaningful counterfactuals while at the same time showing that commonly used intervention techniques have considerable undesired side effects. "

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "We conceptualize LMs as Generalized Causal Models (GCMs), enabling us to generate authentic counterfactual strings from a given input string. By leveraging the Gumbel-Max trick, we separate the deterministic computations of the LM’s forward pass from the inherent randomness of the sampling process. We identify the noise responsible for generating a specific string and reuse the same noise when generating a counterfactual string from the model, post-intervention."
