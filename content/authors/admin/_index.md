Hey! I am a Postdoctoral Researcher and Faculty Fellow (a linear combination of a faculty and a postdoc) at the NYU Center of Data Science. I earned my PhD from the [Natural Language Processing Lab](https://biu-nlp.github.io/) at Bar-Ilan University, supervised by Prof. Yoav Goldberg.

My research focuses on understanding, analyzing, and controlling the internal representations of generative models, particularly language models. I study how neural networks encode structured information, use it to solve complex tasks, and how these representations relate to interpretable concepts. I try---sometimes even successfully---to develop mathematically-principled approaches to interpretability, steering away from ad-hoc methods. 

During my PhD, I have mainly been working on developing techniques to selectively control the information encoded in neural representations, with some fun linguistic side tours. More recently, Iâ€™ve been exploring the framing of language models as causal models and applying controlled approaches to questions of learnability.

Feel free to reach out if you have questions about my work or if you're interested in potential collaborations in these areas! You can also find my CV [here](cv/cv.pdf).
